# kineticgraphs

Framework for creating interactive graphs from a JSON definition

The purpose of this code is to allow interactive diagrams to be authored via JSON only. It is similar in spirit to Vega (https://vega.github.io/vega/) in that it seeks to define a declarative language for creating visualizations. However, while Vega is focused on data visualizations, the focus of this project is diagrams.

There are three sections of code. You may use any or all:
* a *python* authoring environment which functions as a database and server (optional)
* a *javascript* renderer for web pages
* a *swift* renderer for mobile and desktop
